Storage reservation keyword : primitive and non primitive 
- primitive : boolean, char, double, float, byte, short, int, long
- non primitive : strings, arrays
- they reserve some storage in memory to store value.




why different data structure have different speed ? esa kyo hora hai ? 
- example dictionary ; it makes retrieval faster.

Array :
- array is an object in java
- it contains similar type of data
- elements of an array are stored in a contiguous memory location
- it stores all elements sequentially
- its disadvantage is that its size is fixed. And to resolve this problem collection framework is used in java.

syntax to declare array in java :
dataType[] arr; (or)  
dataType []arr; (or)  
dataType arr[];  

initialization : 
arrayRefVar=new datatype[size];  

both : 
int a[]=new int[5];//declaration and instantiation  


Arrays are of two types : static and dynamic 

static arrays : size can't be changed
dynamic arrays : it's size can change
