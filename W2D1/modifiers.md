there are two types of modifiers 
1) access modifiers :- public, private, protected, default
- if you do not mention any modifier for your class, variables and methods then it will be default automatically. 
- 

2) non access modifiers :- static, final, abstract, synchronized, transient, strictfp, native, volatile,  etc
